## Prevents server Advertising
Well looks like everyone have the same feeling when it comes to the annoying server advertising by bots/users in your server.. Not any more.. Plixy will directly remove any sort of link which has the frequently used keywords in it.
Some of the links Plixy blocks are: 
1.https://discordbots.org/servers/
2.http://discordbots.org/servers/
3.www.discordbots.org/servers/
4.https://discord.gg/
5.http://discord.gg/
6.www.discord.gg/
Looking for any other links which are not mentioned in here? No problem, Just fire up your favourite text editor and open the index.js file from the bot's folder, navigate to line no.130 and copy-paste the same code as used there and include the links of your choice.

## Useful Stats on the Console/Status
Want to know the stats of the servers the bot is running on? Well you can now check it out in the console when you start the bot
It gives info about: 
1.Number of Users
2.Number of channels
3.Number of guilds
Too lazy to open up the console every time?Well we knew it that's why we also included a pre written user activity which shows the number of servers and users directly on the game status area of the bot!

## Crptocurrency Stats
Got some crypto traders in the server and they want to keep a track on some crypto currencies? We have an optional function (crypto.js) 
it is linked with config.json so you just need to open up a new terminal and write (node crypto.js) for this function to start working.
Commands are:
'>global' 
'>price (symbol)'
'>info (symbol)'

Note: We are having a public API for all our users which is limited to only 10,000 requests per month, if you want to have a private token of your own server you can go to https://coinmarketcap.com/ and get an API which you have to add in Line number : 17 of crypto.js)

## Random choice
Confused between what drinks or dishes to choose or some other stuff? Use the command >random choices to get a random choice which can help you out in a better decision making.
For example:

# Super exclusive feature (Only for locally running bots)
Wanna know what is?? 
It is .... *Drum rolls* **A home automation feature**... wait what? Yes! a home automation feature!
Let's Know more about it!
We are using http://johnny-five.io/ which is an  JavaScript Robotics & IoT Platform. What it can do is that it can communicate with IOT hardware (Arduino) from the ports of your local machine.So let's say if the server owner is going somewhere away from his native town for some work and he/she don't want their plants to be affected, what they can do is that they can set up a servo motor along with arduino and copy paste the code from http://johnny-five.io/examples/ and modify it in arduino.js in the Bot's folder . Once everything is set up now the owner just needs to use some specific command which the owners can set up by themselves to control the motor! This command should not be disclosed in public as it can turn out to be dangerous and the commands should be entered in a seperate channel with limited access (including the bot).

For now the only thing it can do is turn the LEDs on the arduino board ON and OFF.But once modified according to the owner's needs it can turn out to be a very useful feature.And since this is an optional feature it won't work till we initiate it using (node arduino.js) in the terminal, this will reduce the overall load on your system.

### Here is an example video from some other source which has almost the same functionality as that of arduino.js

# Installation
First of all make sure that you have node.js  installed on your system.
You can download node.js through :https://nodejs.org/en/		
Once you are done with installing node.js you need to clone the git repo,
for this you should have git installed on your system, for installation visit:https://git-scm.com/downloads . 
Open up  your terminal and type git clone https://github.com/umair9747/Plixy/
it will clone the entire repo on your system, 
Now navigate to the directory where the repo was saved and then open up the config.json file, this is where the command prefix and the bot token is saved.We would however not recommend to change the command prefix.Go to // https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ to add up the token for your bot (for further help regarding this visit : https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token )
Now open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where the bot's repo is saved.Now follow these commands: 
1. cd Plixy
2. npm install
3. node index.js (if there are any errors, you just need to see in the terminal which module is missing and enter the command 'npm install modulename' 
Voila! Plixy Bot is Up and running!
